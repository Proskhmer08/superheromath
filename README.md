Deploy a math webapp to help kids learn scenario based math. 
This is simple to deploy on your laptop to help your kids learn scenario based math. 

Simply, change the path to the Penguin icon, and the rest of the images. 
Look for this line in the code:
<img id="penguin" src="/images/penguin.png" alt="Penguin">

Change /images/penguin.png to a path that is in your local directory or a direct link to an image. Then change the path of the rest of the images. 

Save the index.html code as whatever you want but use the .html, then simply click on the file and the page should open. 

If you prefer to not change the rest of the images, you can run live-server and you should have the rest of the images to load. The penguin icon will need to be changed however.
Please look into how live-server works as necessary.
